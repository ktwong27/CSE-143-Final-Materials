  <body><div class="viewer"><h3>acronymFor</h3><div><p>Write a method called acronymFor that takes a list of strings as a parameter and that returns the corresponding acronym.  You form an acronym by combining the capitalized first letter of a series of words.  For example, the list [laughing, out, loud] produces the acronym "LOL".  The list [Computer, Science and, Engineering] produces the acronym "CSE".  You may assume that all of the strings are nonempty.  Your method is not allowed to change the list passed to it as a parameter.  If passed an empty list, your method should return the empty string.</p><p>You may construct iterators and strings, but you are not allowed to construct other structured objects (no set, list, stack, queue, etc.).</p></div></div>
