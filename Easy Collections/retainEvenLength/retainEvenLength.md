  <body><div class="viewer"><h3>retainEvenLength</h3><div><p>Write a method called retainEvenLength that takes a set of strings as a parameter and that retains only the strings of even length from the set, removing all other strings.  For example, if a set called s stores the following values:</p><pre><code>[I, Sam, am, and, do, eggs, green, ham, like, not, them]
</code></pre><p>and the following call is made:</p><pre><code>retainEvenLength(s);
</code></pre><p>then s should store the following values after the call:</p><pre><code>[am, do, eggs, like, them]
</code></pre><p>You may construct iterator objects, but you are not allowed to construct any structured objects to solve the problem (no set, list, stack, queue, string, etc).</p></div></div>
